# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-WORD2VEC-MODEL-ON-WIKIPEDIA-ARTICLES

We shall implement our project on text analysis of webpages from the Wikipedia website.  We will be generating Word2Vec for each word in Wikipedia articles. We employ document vectorization in which we convert the long text documents into concise vector representations of the words that can be searched over efficiently.  Then later we visualise the word2vec with t-SNE visualisation . We also perform K_Means clustering on the word2vec model vocabulary built on our Wikipedia data.
